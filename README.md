# Curio

Express your opinions and thoughts freely without being censored. We will strive to allow any voice (as long as it is appropriate) and providing a secure frontend and backend. Our source code will be open sourced (obviously backend credentials will not be there) and we will be nonprofit.

## Getting Started

Here's how you can deploy a curio model!

### Prerequisites

```
- LAMP / LEMP Stack
- Ability to code (or atleast know what your doing)
- Know how to setup vhosts
```

### Installing

```
1.) Download the .zip from the release page.
2.) Place in LAMP / LEMP stack where it is usually /var/www/<your domain>
3.) Configure vhosts to allow php
4.) restart and enable vhost
```

A now.sh demo will be placed soon

## Tests

In the future, we will eventually test every code automatically via nightly builds.

### What do they test exactly?

They will test if your code works or not, and how we would need to improve it.

```
Let's say feature x is causing some problems in the build when it is not working, we would need to test first to see if it is a bug, and then fix.
```

## Deployment

Use a LEMP (reccomended) or LAMP stack to run your own similar Curio site!

## Built With

* [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/) - The backend
